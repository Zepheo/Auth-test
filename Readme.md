# Auth test v0.1

First iteration of authentication - authorization test.

Using JWT

Should be able to:
  - Create a new user (stored in db)
  - Sign in user with username/password
  - Request public resources as not signed in user
  - Request protected resources as signed in user

In this first iteration the backend will be the focus.
So creating a user, signing in and requesting resources will be done with curl/postman
